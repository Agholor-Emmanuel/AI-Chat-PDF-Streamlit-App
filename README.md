Chat-PDF-Streamlit-App:

An LLM powered Chat-PDF Streamlit-based application

This project involves the development of a Streamlit-based application that enables interactive conversations with PDF documents using a Large Language Model (LLM). The application allows users to upload PDF files, processes the document's content, and uses advanced text embeddings to transform the text into a searchable vector database. With this setup, users can ask natural language questions about the content of the uploaded PDFs and receive accurate and contextually relevant answers directly through a user-friendly interface.

The application is built with Streamlit and integrates key Python libraries such as PyPDF for PDF text extraction, LangChain for text chunking, and a custom LLM model for generating responses. The app provides a seamless experience for file management, document processing, and interactive querying, making it a powerful tool for professionals, researchers, and anyone looking to extract insights from their PDF documents efficiently.
